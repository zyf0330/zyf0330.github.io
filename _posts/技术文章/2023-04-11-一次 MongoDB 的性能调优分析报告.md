## serverStatus().wiredTiger
"bytes currently in the cache" : 5GB

"forced eviction - pages evicted that were clean count" : 5450162
> 被强制驱逐的干净状态的页面数量

"forced eviction - pages evicted that were dirty count" : 19666

> 被强制驱逐的 dirty 状态的页面数量
> dirty 代表 cache 中的数据被更新过，需要写入磁盘

> - Data in the filesystem cache is the same as the on-disk format, including benefits of any compression for data files. The filesystem cache is used by the operating system to reduce disk I/O.
> - Collection data in the WiredTiger internal cache is uncompressed and uses a different representation from the on-disk format. Block compression can provide significant on-disk storage savings, but data must be uncompressed to be manipulated by the server.

## about eviction tuning
The eviction_trigger configuration value (default 95%) is the level at which application threads start to perform eviction. This will "throttle application operations, increasing operation latency", usually resulting in the cache usage staying at this level when there is more cache pressure than eviction worker threads can handle in the background.

# 总结
1. 索引 12GB 已经超过 WiredTiger cache size 7GB，很多索引没有加载到 cache 中。另外 vsize 达到了内存上限，其余空闲内存被用来作为系统 page cache 存放文件缓存，里面存放的大都是 data。
2. 有很多数据的查询和排序不是通过索引执行的，可能是导致 cpu 和内存高的原因。见 metrics.operation.scanAndOrder 和 metrics.queryExecutor.collectionScans.total
3. 慢查询日志显示工作项的慢查询里有很多需要从磁盘读取数据导致的慢，也是因为内存不够用没办法加载数据到内存中。
4. WiredTiger cache 到达上限，引发冷热数据交替进出内存的 page eviction，会导致查询变慢。见 about eviction tuning
5. metrics.operation.scanAndOrder 更多，因为大多数索引更考虑命中过滤字段而非排序字段

# 建议
1. （最优先）增加 mongo 服务器内存。
> 不要增加 WiredTiger cache size，官方不建议这样做。空余内存可以用来作为页面缓存 page cache，存放被压缩的放置在磁盘上的数据，用来给 mongodb 读取。
